		<Toggle question="What is a stag hunt?">
			<p>
				In game theory, a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt"
					rel="external noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">stag hunt</a
				> is a coordination game where two or more players can choose to cooperate and hunt a stag together
				for a large reward, or hunt a hare individually for a smaller and selfish reward.
			</p>
			<p>
				The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau first introduced this game in "A Discourse on
				Inequality" in 1755. The game illustrates the conflict between social cooperation and
				indidivual benefit.

		<Toggle question="Why Trees and what is 'The Merge' ?">
			<p>
				<b>Trees</b> can be found everywhere in the world and are essential for our environment.
				They are living beings and used in many civilizations as a symbol for life.
				<br />
				The Merge Trees want to represent the life happening on the Ethereum blockchain through blocks,
				events, logs (...) and the community behind it.
				<br />
				As The Merge has been successfully accomplished, it also shows that global coordination on complex
				issues is possible.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>The Merge</b> is an upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain that switched from Proof of Work
				to Proof of Stake consensus.<br /> This eliminated the need for energy-intensive mining, and
				instead secures the network using staked ether.<br /> You can find out more

		<Toggle question="On-chain artwork">
			MergeTrees are stored fully onchain on Ethereum and do not host the images files nor metadata
			on other network like IPFS or Arweave.
			<br /> <br />
			From the tree's traits, all the branches characteristics are computed and put together to draw
			the entire tree. Once it is ready, the resulting SVG is encoded in base64.
			<br /><br />
			<h3>Rendering</h3>
			Rendering trees on-chain wasn't easy, but it's real now. A first approach involved doing a lot
			of maths in Solidity to calculate each branch position. But there were a lot of limitations about
			the tree parameters.
			<br />
			So after some research, I decided to leverage the power of
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/">SVG</a>
			and its
			<a
				href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use"
				rel="external noopener noreferrer"
				target="_blank">&lt;use href &gt;</a
			>
			, which allow to re-use parts of a document. For the tree, each branch is drawn by reusing the
			previous one and scaling/rotating it.
			<br />
			That's how it is stored on-chain and for old computers why you can experience some slowness (especially
			on animated one, but hey see it as an homage to PoW üòâÔ∏è).
			<br />
			<br />
			A detailed article will be published soon.

			<h3>Transfers ü§ù</h3>
			<p>
				At every NFT transfer, the tree will add or remove 1 segment / level depending on the growth
				phase. Allowing it to be a simple trunk or a beautiful tree with 6 segments.

			<h3>Length growth üìà or decline üìâ?</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				For every block mined in the blockchain, the tree will grow in length if we are in a growing
				phase or decline otherwise. A growthDivider is also set to tweak it more precisely.

			<h3>Colors üé®</h3>
			Since we all share the same planet but have a highly unequal impact on it, certain MergeTrees have
			the unique ability to alter 1 bit of the color across ALL trees.
			<br /> If they manage to reach consensus, they might be able to turn the trees and their
			markers to
			<span class="text-red-500">red</span>, <span class="text-blue-500">blue</span> or

		<Toggle question="Seeder contract">
			<p>
				The MergeTree Seeder contract is used to determine traits during the minting process. It is
				upgradeable to support future trait generation algorithm upgrades and can be locked by the
				team to prevent any further update.
				<br />
				Currently, traits are determined using pseudo-random number generation:
				<br /><br />
				<code>keccak256( abi.encodePacked( block.prevrandao, address(this), tokenId ) );</code>
				<br /><br />
				Please note that it is not truly random and could be predicted and/or biased by validators, but
				in a limited way.
